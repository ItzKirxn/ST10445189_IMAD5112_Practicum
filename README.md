## Introduction

Firstly, my main goal for this app was to create a weather app for a local weather organisation the organisations specifications were 
that it must not only provide average temperature for the week but also to allow users to look at detailed information regarding the weather each day
i was tasked to create this app. this the the starting screen wen you have just opened the application it consists of the name of the app the logo
,and a button to go to the next sceen.

Moreover, my apps user interface was designed to be simple yet engaging and welcoming incorporating images of background weather and it displays the weather information 
in a simple list format as it is very readable and simple also easy to navigate as the buttons are minimalitically sized for each screen, you can see this in the image below.

furthermore the last screen as you can see below has two buttons and is sorted in arrays or a list type format making it easier for the user to see in addition to having two button 
each one has a purpose the go back button is to send the user back to the home screen and the rest close button is to exit the application completely.
